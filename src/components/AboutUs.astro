            Destiny On Board is an international education agency helping students study in Canada, the U.S., Australia, and Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were international students, just like you. We've applied to programs, struggled through visa paperwork, and learned the hard way what actually works.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why we built Destiny. We're a team that helps you come to Canada and stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 300 students supported and a 97% success rate, we know how to guide you from day one to long-term residency.
